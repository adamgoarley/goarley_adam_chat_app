## Adam Goarley's Chat App (Fun Chat)

Fun Chat is a chat application. This was build off of the in class build but has a new and updated design and more functionality!

### How do you run Fun Chat?

You will have to clone the github repo and open it in your code editor of choice. Next you will have to open the file in the terminal window. Next you will have to type "npm install" and press enter which will install the node modules that are needed to run the app. After that is complete you will need to go to your web browser and type in localhost:3030
